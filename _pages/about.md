Welcome to my page. This is Zihan Lou. I'm a third year undergraduate student majoring in statistics from [School of Economics and Finance](http://sef.xjtu.edu.cn) at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn) under supervision of [Prof. Hua Liu](http://sef.xjtu.edu.cn/info/1086/18129.htm).
My research interests lie in the field of optization and statistical machine learning, especially applied optimization and machine learning method to functional data analysis. I am doing researches about functional data analysis optimization with SGD(stochastic gradient descent) algorithms under the supervision of [Prof. Hua liu](http://sef.xjtu.edu.cn/info/1086/18129.htm). Before that, I did some research about timeseries analysis. I applied timeseries analysis to predicting China's economy development and unemployment under the supervison of [Prof. Hua Liu](http://sef.xjtu.edu.cn/info/1086/18129.htm) and [Prof. Cong Li](http://sef.xjtu.edu.cn/info/1086/9392.htm).
I am applying a Ph.D in statistics in 2025 fall, if you are interested in me, contact with me.([e-mail1](louzihan314@stu.xjtu.edu.cn), [e-mail2](lzhpeach@gmail.com))
